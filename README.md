- 👋 Hi, I’m @asignia
- 👀 I’m interested in learning stuff. I've been exposed to a little bit of everything and know none of it. 
I am a captioner by trade - I use a steno keyboard to caption a lot of stuff in realtime. Have you attended a conference with captions since 2015? You might have seen my work!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning stuff. Just getting started. I want to kinda make some fun things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything accessibility. 
- 📫 How to reach me - Twitter @asignia
